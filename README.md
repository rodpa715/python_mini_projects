# python_mini_projects
Here I will post mini-projects that I code while learning Python 3. This will mainly serve to share and see my progress.

In week 1:

Guess the number - You have to input the number the code is choosing randomly.

Roll the dice - It will print out an integer ranging from 1-6.

String reverse - This is simply the code used to reverse a string using the built-in slice function.

Attention Calculator - This will ask you a series of question's about your partner and based on those questions it will determine the attention your partner deserves. (It was pretty fun to build this one.)

Pig Latin -  This is a game of alterations played on the English language game. Input a word and you'll get a result. Tried to make this one error proof and was fun to polish the program so that only words are accepted.
